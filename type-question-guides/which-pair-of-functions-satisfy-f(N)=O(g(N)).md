# Which pair of functions satisfy f(N) = O(g(N))

Big O notation

A notation for classifying asymptotic behavior

> Tilde approximations. We use tilde approximations, where we throw away low-order terms that complicate formulas. We write ~ f(N) to represent any function that when divided by f(N) approaches 1 as N grows. We write g(N) ~ f(N) to indicate that g(N) / f(N) approaches 1 as N grows.

> Order-of-growth classifications. Most often, we work with tilde approximations of the form g(N) ~ a f(N) where f(N) = N^b log^c N and refer to f(N) as the The order of growth of g(N).

## Sample question

Q: Which pair of functions satisfy f(N) = O(g(N))

- [x] `f(N) = 17` and `g(N) = 1`
- [ ] `f(N) = N^5` and `g(N) = 5 * N^4`
- [ ] `f(N) = (log N) * (log N)` and `g(N) = 2 * log N`
- [ ] `f(N) = (N + 1) * (N + 1)` and `g(N) = N * log N`

## Solution method
**In short**: Identify the order-of-growth of both functions. If the order-of-growth class of `f` is smaller than or equal to the order-of-growth of `g`, then `f(x) = O(g(x))` is true.

Formally: We say that `f(N) = O(g(N))` if there exist constants `c` and `N0` such that `|f(N)| < c * g(N) for all N > N0`.

**A step by step process**:

1. Identify the largest term of both functions, and ignore the other terms.
2. Find tilde approximation of both functions.
    - Heuristic: Ignore terms and constants which are insignificant when `N` goes towards infinity.
    - Formally: `f(N) ~ g(N)` is true when the limit of `f(N)/g(N)` of `N`as `N` approaches `âˆž` is `1`.
    - For instance: `(N+1)^2` is `~N^2`, since the constant `1` becomes insignificant, and the functions `(N+1)^2` and `N^2` converges, when `N` goes toward infinity.
3. Find the smallest correct Big O estimate of both functions.
    - Heuristic: Strip away all constant factors.
    - Formally: We say that `f(N) = O(g(N))` if there exist constants `c` and `N0` such that `|f(N)| < c * g(N)` for all `N > N0`.
    - For instance: `5N^4` is `O(N^4)` and `(1/5) * N^4` is `O(N^4)`
4. Recall the different order-of-growth's and grow-rate ranking
    - From slowest growing to faster growing: constant, logarithmic, square root, linear, linearithmic, quadratic ... etc.
5. Ask yourself if `f` is in a slower-growing category or the same category as `g`.

This longer process might be an unnecessarily long process for simple questions.

For the sample question you would ideally quickly spot that option a is true, because `f(x) = 17` and `g(x) = 1` are both constant functions.
